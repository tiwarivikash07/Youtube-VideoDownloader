# Youtube-VideoDownloader
This Python project utilizes the yt-dlp library to download YouTube videos based on user-defined quality preferences. The script starts by prompting the user to enter a YouTube video URL. It then retrieves the available video formats and qualities. These options, such as 1080p, best, or worst, are displayed to the user, who is asked to select one. If the user chooses an invalid quality, the script will prompt them to select a valid option. After a valid quality is selected, the script proceeds to download the video in the chosen format. The downloaded video is saved with its title as the file name. This process provides a simple and interactive way to download YouTube videos in different qualities, making it easy for users to tailor their download experience.
